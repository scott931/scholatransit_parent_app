# WhatsApp Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue: WhatsApp Not Working

Based on the analysis, here are the most likely causes and solutions:

## 🔍 **Step 1: Check WhatsApp Installation**

### On Android:
1. **Verify WhatsApp is installed**: Go to Google Play Store and search for "WhatsApp"
2. **Check if WhatsApp is set as default**: Go to Settings > Apps > WhatsApp > Set as default
3. **Test manually**: Try opening WhatsApp directly from your device

### On iOS:
1. **Verify WhatsApp is installed**: Check App Store for WhatsApp
2. **Check URL schemes**: WhatsApp should be registered to handle `wa.me` URLs

## 🔍 **Step 2: Test the Debug Screen**

Navigate to `/whatsapp-debug` in your app to test the WhatsApp functionality:

1. **Open the app**
2. **Navigate to**: `/whatsapp-debug` (you can add this as a button in your app)
3. **Test with your own phone number first**
4. **Check the debug output for errors**

## 🔍 **Step 3: Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: "Cannot launch WhatsApp URL"
**Solution:**
- Make sure WhatsApp is installed
- Check if the phone number format is correct
- Try with a different phone number

### Issue 2: "Invalid phone number"
**Solution:**
- Ensure phone numbers are in international format (+254...)
- Check if the phone number is not a placeholder (+1234567890)

### Issue 3: WhatsApp opens but doesn't show the message
**Solution:**
- This is normal behavior - WhatsApp may not always show pre-filled messages
- The contact will still be opened correctly

## 🔍 **Step 4: Test Phone Numbers**

### Current Configuration:
- **Driver Phone**: `+254717127082`
- **Admin Phone**: `+254703149045`

### Test with these numbers:
1. **Your own phone number** (replace +1234567890 with your real number)
2. **Driver number above**
3. **Admin number above**

## 🔍 **Step 5: Manual Testing**

### Test 1: Direct URL Test
Try opening this URL in your browser:
```
https://wa.me/254717127082?text=Hello%20from%20the%20school%20bus%20app
```

### Test 2: App Integration Test
1. Open your app
2. Go to Conversations
3. Tap on any conversation
4. Should redirect to WhatsApp

### Test 3: Parent Messages Test
1. Open Parent Messages screen
2. Tap "Contact Driver" or "Contact Admin"
3. Should launch WhatsApp

## 🔍 **Step 6: Debug Information**

### Check these files:
1. **`lib/core/services/whatsapp_service.dart`** - Main WhatsApp service
2. **`lib/features/communication/screens/whatsapp_redirect_screen.dart`** - Redirect screen
3. **`lib/features/communication/screens/conversations_screen.dart`** - Conversations list
4. **`lib/features/parent/screens/parent_messages_screen.dart`** - Parent messages

### Key Methods to Check:
- `WhatsAppService.launchWhatsApp()` - Main launch method
- `WhatsAppService.isValidPhoneNumber()` - Phone validation
- `_navigateToChat()` - Navigation to WhatsApp

## 🔍 **Step 7: Flutter Environment Issues**

The Flutter SDK appears to have issues. Try:

1. **Clean and rebuild**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Check Flutter version**:
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```

3. **Update Flutter**:
   ```bash
   flutter upgrade
   ```

## 🔍 **Step 8: Platform-Specific Issues**

### Android:
- Check `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` for internet permission
- Ensure `url_launcher` plugin is properly configured

### iOS:
- Check `ios/Runner/Info.plist` for URL schemes
- Ensure `url_launcher` plugin is properly configured

## 🔍 **Step 9: Quick Fixes**

### Fix 1: Update Phone Numbers
Replace placeholder numbers in `whatsapp_service.dart`:
```dart
static String getDefaultParentPhone() {
  return '+254XXXXXXXXX'; // Replace with real parent phone
}
```

### Fix 2: Add Error Handling
The app should show error dialogs if WhatsApp fails to launch.

### Fix 3: Test with Different Numbers
Try with your own phone number first to verify the integration works.

## 🔍 **Step 10: Verification Checklist**

- [ ] Phone numbers are in correct format (+254...)
- [ ] No placeholder numbers (+1234567890)
- [ ] App has internet permission
- [ ] URL launcher plugin is working
- [ ] Debug screen shows no errors

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the debug screen** first
2. **Try with your own phone number**
3. **Check the debug output for specific errors**
4. **Verify WhatsApp is installed and working**
5. **Test the manual URL in browser**

## 📞 **Support**

If issues persist:
