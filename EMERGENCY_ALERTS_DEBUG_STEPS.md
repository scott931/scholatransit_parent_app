# Emergency Alerts Debug Steps

## 🎯 Issue: Emergency Alerts Not Loading

Based on the analysis, the issue is likely **NOT** with token storage (which is working correctly), but with **token retrieval or API header sending**.

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### **Step 1: Test the Enhanced Debugging**

1. **Run your app** and go through the login process
2. **Go to notifications screen** and tap the purple "Test Emergency Alerts" button
3. **Check the console logs** for the enhanced debugging

### **Step 2: Look for These Specific Issues**

#### **Issue 1: Token Not Retrieved**
**Look for:**
```
❌ No token found - this is the problem!
🔍 Checking if user is authenticated...
🔍 Auth state: true/false
🔍 Parent: true/false
```

**If you see this:**
- The token is not being retrieved from storage
- Check if `StorageService.getAuthToken()` is working
- Check if the token is being cleared somewhere

#### **Issue 2: Token Format Issue**
**Look for:**
```
🔐 Token Status:
  - Token exists: true
  - Token length: 228
  - Token preview: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
  - Token format: Valid JWT
  - Storage test: Working
```

**If you see:**
```
  - Token format: Invalid format
  - Storage test: Failed
```
**Then:** There's an issue with token storage/retrieval

#### **Issue 3: API Service Not Sending Headers**
**Look for:**
```
🔐 API: Using authentication token for GET /api/v1/emergency/alerts/
✅ API: Valid JWT token format detected
🔐 Full Authorization header: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

**If you see:**
```
⚠️ API: No authentication token found for GET /api/v1/emergency/alerts/
⚠️ This will likely result in 401 Unauthorized
```
**Then:** The API service is not retrieving the token

#### **Issue 4: Server Rejecting Token**
**Look for:**
```
🚨 Emergency Alerts API Response:
  - Success: false
  - Status Code: 401
  - Error: Given token not valid for any token type
```

**If you see this:**
- The token is being sent but the server rejects it
- Token might be expired or invalid
- Check if automatic token refresh is working

## 🧪 Expected Log Output

### **Successful Emergency Alerts:**
```
🔐 Auth State:
  - Is authenticated: true
  - Parent: true
  - Loading: false
  - Error: null

🔐 Token Status:
  - Token exists: true
  - Token length: 228
  - Token preview: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
  - Token format: Valid JWT
  - Storage test: Working

🔐 API: Using authentication token for GET /api/v1/emergency/alerts/
✅ API: Valid JWT token format detected
🔐 Full Authorization header: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...

🚨 Emergency Alerts API Response:
  - Success: true
  - Status Code: 200
  - Data: [list of alerts]
  - Error: null

✅ Emergency alerts loaded successfully!
📊 Data count: 5
```

### **Failed Emergency Alerts (Token Issue):**
```
🔐 Token Status:
  - Token exists: false

❌ No token found - this is the problem!
🔍 Auth state: true
🔍 Parent: true

⚠️ API: No authentication token found for GET /api/v1/emergency/alerts/
⚠️ This will likely result in 401 Unauthorized

🚨 Emergency Alerts API Response:
  - Success: false
  - Status Code: 401
  - Error: Authentication credentials were not provided
```

### **Failed Emergency Alerts (Server Rejection):**
```
🔐 Token Status:
  - Token exists: true
  - Token format: Valid JWT

🔐 API: Using authentication token for GET /api/v1/emergency/alerts/
✅ API: Valid JWT token format detected

🚨 Emergency Alerts API Response:
  - Success: false
  - Status Code: 401
  - Error: Given token not valid for any token type

🔐 401 Unauthorized - authentication issue
```

## 🔧 Solutions Based on Issues

### **Solution 1: Token Not Retrieved**
If token is not being retrieved:
1. Check if `StorageService.getAuthToken()` is working
2. Check if token is being cleared after login
3. Check if there's a timing issue

### **Solution 2: Token Format Issue**
If token format is invalid:
1. Check if token is being corrupted during storage
2. Check if there are encoding issues
3. Check if token is being truncated

### **Solution 3: API Service Issue**
If API service is not sending headers:
1. Check if `_authInterceptor` is working
2. Check if token retrieval is working in the interceptor
3. Check if there are any exceptions in the interceptor

### **Solution 4: Server Rejection**
If server is rejecting the token:
1. Check if token is expired
2. Check if automatic token refresh is working
3. Check if the token is valid for the API endpoint

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run the enhanced debugging** and check the console logs
2. **Identify the specific issue** from the logs above
3. **Apply the appropriate solution** based on the issue found
4. **Test again** to confirm the fix

The enhanced debugging will show you exactly where the problem is occurring! 🔍✨
